# tw-animate-css

TailwindCSS v4.0 compatible replacement for [`tailwindcss-animate`][Original_Plugin_GitHub].

Instead of being an old-fashioned JavaScript plugin, this package provides a
CSS file defining custom utilities based on the new
[CSS-first architecture][TailwindCSS_Custom_Utilities].

## Installation

### NPM

1. Install the package with `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tw-animate-css
   ```

2. Add the following line to your `app.css` or `globals.css` file:

   ```css
   @import "tw-animate-css";
   ```

3. Start using the animations!

> [!NOTE]
> This code works with esbuild, Vite and probably other bundlers too. If you are
> using a different bundler, the syntax may differ.
> [Let me know][Create_Issue] how it works and I'll update the documentation.

### Manual download

1. Download the [`tw-animate.css`][CSS_File]
   file from GitHub and place it next to your `app.css` or `globals.css` file.
2. Add the following line to your `app.css` or `globals.css` file:

   ```css
   @import "./tw-animate.css";
   ```

3. Start using the animations!

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation is currently under construction. Please refer to the [original documentation][Original_Plugin_Docs] for now.
