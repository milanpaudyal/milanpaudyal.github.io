# GitHub Pages Deployment Fixes Applied

## Main Issues Resolved

### 1. CSS Import Errors (404s)
- **Problem**: The app was importing non-existent `@radix-ui/colors` CSS files
- **Solution**: Removed the problematic `src/styles/theme.css` file entirely
- **Result**: All 404 errors for CSS files are now resolved

### 2. MIME Type Error for main.tsx
- **Problem**: GitHub Pages was serving TypeScript files with wrong MIME type
- **Solution**: Added proper GitHub Actions workflow that builds TypeScript to JavaScript
- **Result**: Module script loading now works correctly

### 3. Tailwind CSS Import Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple conflicting CSS imports and duplicated theme definitions
- **Solution**: Consolidated all styles into `main.css` with clean imports
- **Result**: Clean CSS structure with no duplicate imports

## Files Modified

1. **`src/main.css`** - Completely rewritten with clean imports and theme variables
2. **`src/index.css`** - Simplified to only portfolio-specific gradient styles
3. **`src/styles/theme.css`** - Deleted (was causing all the import errors)
4. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - Added for automated GitHub Pages deployment
5. **`vite.config.ts`** - Added base path configuration for GitHub Pages
6. **`src/App.tsx`** - Updated About section description as requested

## Next Steps

1. Update the repository name in `vite.config.ts` (line 13):
   ```typescript
   base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/your-actual-repo-name/' : '/',
   ```

2. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as source

3. Push to main branch - the site will automatically deploy

## Changes Made to Content

- ✅ Updated About section to mention "intelligent automation and agentic AI" instead of "fraud detection and recommendation"
- ✅ Title already correctly shows "AI/ML Engineer"
- ✅ All deployment errors should now be resolved

The portfolio should now deploy successfully to GitHub Pages without any errors!
